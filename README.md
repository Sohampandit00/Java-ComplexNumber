# Java-ComplexNumber

A Java class representing complex numbers with real and imaginary parts, constructors, and methods for arithmetic operations.

## Features

* Defines a `Complex` class with `realPart` and `imaginaryPart` instance variables.
* Implements two constructors: one with default values (0.0) and another with specified real and imaginary parts.
* Provides setter and getter methods for the real and imaginary parts.
* Implements `addComplex` and `subtractComplex` methods to perform addition and subtraction of complex numbers.
* Implements a `toString` method for easy printing of complex numbers.

## Technologies Used

* Java

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2.  Compile the `Complex.java` and `ComplexDriver.java` files using `javac Complex.java ComplexDriver.java`.
3.  Run the `ComplexDriver` program using `java ComplexDriver`.
4.  The program will output the results of complex number operations to the console.

## Example Output
Complex number 1: 3.0 + 4.0i
Complex number 2: 1.0 - 2.0i
Sum: 4.0 + 2.0i
Difference: 2.0 + 6.0i
